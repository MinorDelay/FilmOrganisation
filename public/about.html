  <h2 class="title">About</h2>
  <p>The majority of people watches movies. However, determining which movie to watch is can be very difficult as there is an enormous catalogue of movies at our
  disposal. Luckily, there are websites such as <a href="imdb.com/">imdb.com</a> who make the choice of determining which movie to watch a lot easier. These
  sites provide a comprehensive overview of all information you might be interested in, e.g. title, rating, and actors starring in a movie. This way users can
  filter the movies they feel like watching based on one or multiple aforementioned preferences.
  <br>
  Even though the amount of information on IMDB is comprehensive, data about the prices of movies isn't present. This is where the project turned to
  <a href="bol.com">bol.com</a> as this website is one of the largest online web stores of the Netherlands. We matched properties from movies in 2018
  from IMDB with properties from movies in 2018 available on bol.com to further complete the overview of properties available about movies.
  <br>
  Furthermore, we assessed that this database was lacking the ability to provide movie recommendations based on the mood the user is in. Mood is a large
  contributing factor when deciding which movie to watch. A comedy might eleviate a more negative mood, whereas a happy mood can handle a more negative or serious
  themed movie or documentary.</p>

  <h2 class="ontology">Ontology</h2>
  <p>After extraction of data from both <a href="imdb.com">imdb.com</a> and <a href="bol.com">bol.com</a> through webscraping we set out to formalize
    the way this data is linked to each other. What is convenient of good websites is the ability to select a certain property you're interested in and be able
    to get referenced further to the data that is linked to it. For instance, Chadwick Boseman an actor starring in Black Panther. He references to his co-actor
    Michael B. Jordan who then can be referenced to the movie Fahrenheit 451 as Michael B. Jordan stars in this movie too. This is one of the many instances
    it can be efficient to have data linked to each other. How all data relates to each other is formalized in an ontology. Understanding the ontology canvas
    help improve the usability of a website.
    <br>
    To know how the data of thecompletescreening.com is structure we have provided the image below. In addition the OWL and Turtle files of the ontology can be found
    <a href="./data/OntologyOWL.xml">here</a> and <a href="./data/turtle.owl">here</a> respectively.
