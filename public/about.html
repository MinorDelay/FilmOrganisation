    <p>The majority of people watches movies. However, determining which movie to watch can be very difficult as there
      is an enormous catalogue of movies at our
      disposal. Luckily, there are websites such as <a href="https://IMDB.com/">IMDB.com</a> who make the choice of determining
      which movie to watch a lot easier. These
      websites provide a comprehensive overview of all information you might be interested in, e.g. title, rating, and actors
      starring in a movie. This way users can
      filter the movies they feel like watching based on one or multiple aforementioned preferences.
      <br>
      Even though the amount of information on IMDB is comprehensive, data about the prices of movies isn't present. This
      is where the project turned to
      <a href="https://bol.com">bol.com</a> as this website is one of the largest online web stores of the Netherlands. We matched
      properties from movies released in 2018 available at IMDB withh properties from movies released in 2018 available on bol.com
      to further complete the generalized overview of properties available about movies.
      <br>
      Furthermore, we assessed that this database was lacking the ability to provide movie recommendations based on the
      mood the user is in. Mood is a large
      contributing factor when deciding which movie to watch. A comedy might eleviate a more negative mood, whereas a
      happy mood can handle a more negative or serious
      themed movie or documentary.</p>

    <h2 class="titleOntology">Ontology</h2>
    <p>After extraction of data from both IMDB.com and Bol.com through webscraping we set out to formalize the way
      this data is linked to each other. What is convenient of well designed websites is the ability to select a certain
      property you're interested in and be able
      to get referenced further to data that is linked to it. For instance, say you liked the movie Black Panther, starring Chadwick Boseman
      and one of his co-actors of whom you don't know the name. As the starring actors can be found by searching Black Panther and the co-stars
      can be found by searching Chadwick Boseman the the name of the unknown actor can be determined. Via his name, the entire oeuvre can be
      retrieved. This is one of the many instances it can be efficient to have data linked to each other. How all data relates to each other
      is formalized in an ontology. Understanding the ontology can help improve the usability of a website as the connections between properties
      is visualized.

      To know how the data of thecompletescreening.com is structured we have provided the image below. In addition the OWL
      and Turtle files of the ontology can be found
