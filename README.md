Node.js is used to connect the database with the server.

Used packages (manual install might be needed if the website does not work):
```
- express
- sqlite3
- body-parser
```

To start server
```
node server
```
In the webbrowser go to
```
localhost:3000
```
For the home page front-end, a template is used. The rest is created by ourselves.
